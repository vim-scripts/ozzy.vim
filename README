Database-based file search. Ozzy does not perform a runtime file search. 
Instead, it keeps track of all files you open over time into an external database,
so that you can open them regardless your current working directory. 
The only thing you are required to do in order to open a certain file is to edit it at least once.

Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ozzy

This is the most important command. Use this command and a small window will 
popup at the bottom of the Vim window with a special command line. Start typing 
the file you want to open and you'll see the list updating as you type. Below there
is list of all the mappings you can use to interact with the window:

  * UP, TAB, CTRL+K: move up in the list.

  * DOWN, CTRL+J: move down in the list.

  * RETURN, CTRL+O, CTRL+E: open the selected file.

  * ESC, CTRL+C: close the list.

  * CTRL+D: delete the selected file (it won't show up anymore in the list until
                     you'll edit that file again).

  * CTRL+U: clear the current search.


OzzyReset

To remove all tracked files from the database.


Calculator on the fly
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ozzy integrates a tiny calculator. Just type some arithmetic expressions in the 
command line and you'll see the result. The expressions must follow the `python` 
notation, so you'll have to use the `**` operator in order to compute the power of a 
number. All functions from the python `math` module are also available.
